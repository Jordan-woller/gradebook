# Gradebook

## Summary
Our project utilizes an input file, along with user input, in order to create an output that would inform the user about their requested grades. Through this project the user can change any specific grade, and/or add a new grade to any category in the input file. Once changes to the input file are complete, the user can choose to return just a name of an assignment and its grade, or each grade in a chosen category along with its total. If the user chooses the course option, they have three choices: each grade in the category and the overall course grade, each overall category grade and then the course grade, or just the course grade. The user can choose as many of these options as they choose as the program will not close until they choose to quit. 

## Planning

For our gradebook we knew we were in for a large program with plenty of chances for issues. Due to this, we decided that it would be best
if we all got together to plan and write out pseudocode before anything else. After we had reached a plan we were comfortable with, it was time
start implementing. We thought it would be best to code in CS50, that way we would all be able to be in the file and making changes at the same time. 
Using this, we were all able to meet up and code together without being in eachothers way and not sharing our laptop when explaining an issue we were having. Our next issue was breaking up the code so everyone had an even portion of work. After plenty of deliberation, our best plan was as follows.

Addie: Finding the individual grade of an assignment
Cassidy: Finding the overall grade of a category of assignments
Chace: Finding the overall course grade, dropping the lowest lab, creating an outfile
Jordan: Putting everything together in the main file, making the code user friendly, and error handling

We found that this plan of action worked best and while we helped eachother in our respective sections, we stuck to our plan.

# Gradebook

## Summary
Our project utilizes an input file, along with user input, in order to create an output that would inform the user about their requested grades. Through this project the user can change any specific grade, and/or add a new grade to any category in the input file. Once changes to the input file are complete, the user can choose to return just a name of an assignment and its grade, or each grade in a chosen category along with its total. If the user chooses the course option, they have three choices: each grade in the category and the overall course grade, each overall category grade and then the course grade, or just the course grade. The user can choose as many of these options as they choose as the program will not close until they choose to quit.
